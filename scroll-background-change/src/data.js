        paragraph: "Acta non verba is often translated as “actions, not words” but we found a different translation that we prefer: “deeds, not words.” The Latin word acta comes from the Latin root agere which evolved into actus, meaning “event” or “thing that was done,” which is the same root for the English “action.” However, acta literally means “register of events” and so we feel that “deeds” better conveys the gravity of our actions and makes us think more about the legacy we leave behind through the things we do. A sister phrase, actis non verbis, shares the same general meaning: “by means of things done, not by means of words.”",
